Finding trustworthy local service professionals remains a major challenge due to unverified contacts, lack of transparency, and unreliable intermediaries. HomeHelpHub addresses this problem by providing a secure, transparent, and efficient digital platform. It is a two-sided application connecting clients directly with verified local service providers such as plumbers, electricians, and carpenters. The project flow starts with user authentication, followed by role selection, service browsing, provider selection, and booking confirmation. Clients can register, search services, view provider profiles, and book appointments, while service providers manage profiles, upload verification documents, and respond to requests. Google technologies such as Firebase Authentication, Google Sign-In, and Firebase Realtime Database are used. Key advantages include real-time updates, scalability, data security, and empowerment of local professionals.
